warnings	"Animal studies have shown that 5-HTP can be toxic at excessive levels (5), and a few cases of toxicity in humans have been reported (see Adverse Reaction Case Reports). The clinical relevance, however, has yet to be determined.
Older reports identified contaminants in some 5-HTP supplements (31) (32) (33)."
contraindications	"Patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants, or other serotonergic drugs should avoid taking 5-HTP without the supervision of the treating physician due to the theoretical potential for serotonin syndrome or other side effects.
Use of this supplement should also be avoided if taking other supplements such as St John’s wort or SAM-e because these products may also affect serotonin levels."
clinical_summary	"5-HTP or L-5-Hydroxytryptophan is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin. It is formed by hydroxylation of the amino acid L-tryptophan. 5-HTP is marketed as a dietary supplement for sleep, to improve mood and well-being, and to suppress appetite. Seeds from the African shrub Griffonia simplicifolia are a major source for these supplements due to their high 5-HTP content (1) (2).
In animal models, anxiolytic and antidyskinetic effects have been demonstrated (3) (4). 5-HTP has also been shown to restore serotonin levels or, at excessive levels, to induce serotonin syndrome (5) (6).
In humans, much of the research on 5-HTP involves small trials with mixed results. A few studies suggest 5-HTP may reduce anxiety (7) (8). Other trials found benefits for depression (2) (9) (10), but not treatment-resistant depression (11) (12). Yet, results from more recent studies suggest antidepressant effects comparable with fluoxetine (13), and potential benefit as part of augmentation therapy for drug-resistant depression (14).
5-HTP has also been evaluated for obesity. Preliminary findings suggest it may help decrease food intake and increase weight loss and early satiety (15) (16). More recently, a sublingual 5-HTP spray increased appetite control in overweight women (17) (18).
Other preliminary studies suggest benefit for patients with fibromyalgia (19), but not for postmenopausal hot flashes (20) or tardive dyskinesia (21). 5-HTP does not appear to reduce chronic tension headaches, although a decrease in analgesic use was noted (22). It was also ineffective as prophylaxis for childhood migraine (23), but may improve pediatric sleep terrors (24).
Larger well-designed studies are needed to determine the populations and conditions for which 5-HTP supplementation may be useful, and to determine safety particularly in conjunction with other serotonergic medications including antidepressants."
food_sources	Dietary sources of L-tryptophan, which the body converts to 5-HTP, include turkey, chicken, pumpkin seeds, spinach, milk, and bananas.
mechanism_of_action	"5-HTP crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases serotonin synthesis (25). The advantage of 5-HTP over L-tryptophan is its ability to bypass the rate-limiting step that tryptophan must undergo via the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase to convert to 5-HTP. In addition, this enzyme can be inhibited by various factors including B6 or magnesium deficiencies, stress, or insulin resistance, and make tryptophan unavailable for serotonin production (2).
Relaxation and anxiolytic properties are attributed to the ability of 5-HTP to elevate CNS serotonin levels (2). 5-HTP was shown to augment neuroendocrine response to an SSRI via increased presynaptic 5HT availability, thus enhancing 5HT release into the synapse (26). It was also proposed to potentially reduce hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer or with risk of breast cancer by enhancing serotonin levels (27) , but a clinical study in postmenopausal women found it ineffective (20) .
5-HTP can also increase levels of melatonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (28) (29), compounds involved in mood and sleep regulation and whose mechanistic pathways may also be stimulated (2). As abnormalities in serotonin and epinephrine pathways have been suspected in fibromyalgia and other chronic diseases (5) (30), this may help to explain preliminary benefits seen with 5-HTP supplementation in other disease states.
Additional studies are needed to further identify the mechanisms and conditions under which 5-HTP may exert positive effects or pose concerns when used, especially with other medications due to its modulatory effects on neurotransmitters."

clinical_summary	"Andrographis paniculata is a bitter tasting annual plant prevalent in much of Asia. It is often used in combination with other herbs in traditional medicine to treat infectious diseases and associated fevers. It is also used in folk medicine to treat snakebites. Andrographis is promoted in supplemental form for cancer prevention, cancer treatment, and to counter the toxicity of chemotherapy in humans. Formulations containing standardized extracts of andrographis are also marketed for colds and flu.
In vitro and animal studies indicate that andrographis has antimicrobial (23), anti-inflammatory (26), antioxidant (27),anticancer (13) (18) and antimetastatic (15) properties.

Kan Jang, a standardized extract of Andrographis paniculata and Eleutherococcus senticosus, has been studied in manufacturer-sponsored clinical trials for relief of respiratory symptoms from cold and flu (1) (2) (3) (4).
An andrographis extract was found useful in treating the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (5); another study found it as effective as mesalamine in treating ulcerative colitis (6).
Andrographis extracts also reduced rheumatoid factors and relieved rheumatoid arthritis symptoms (7)."
food_sources	
mechanism_of_action	"The active constituents of andrographis are diterpenoid lactones known as andrographolides (10) (11). They exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting nitric oxide production and cyclooxygenase-2 expression (26). In mouse hepatocytes, andrographis induced mRNA expression of P450 subfamily members, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, in a concentration-dependent manner (31). In other studies, andrographis extract demonstrated a calcium channel inhibition effect that can cause smooth muscle relaxation and a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate (32), as well as relaxation of uterus (33). It also showed antiplatelet effects by inhibiting thrombin (34) and platelet activating factor (35). When given orally to mice, andrographis extract was shown to neutralize snake venom (9). In addition, andrographolides inhibit HIV-induced dysregulation of cell cycle and increased CD4+ lymphocyte levels in HIV-1 patients (10).
Andrographolides also demonstrate anticancer effects. They inhibited IL-6 expression and IL-6-mediated signals in human prostate cancer cells, and suppressed tumor growth of DU145 human prostate tumors in mice (12); inhibited migration and invasion of human colorectal cancer Lovo cells through suppression of mRNA and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 protein levels (13); and MMP-2 activity in human HT29 colon cancer cells (14). An in vitro study found that andrographolide reduced the invasiveness of human A549 non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway and inhibiting MMP-7 expression (15). Andrographolides were shown to cause apoptosis of human hepatoma cancer cells through the induction of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (16) and through the activation of caspases in vitro (17). They inhibited E-selection expression resulting in the decreased adhesion of gastric cancer cells to endothelial tissues (18); and also inhibited tumor cell growth by stimulating cytotoxic T-lymphocyte production through IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion (19) (25). An in vitro study found that andrographolide enhanced doxorubicin-induced cell death in several human cancer cell lines, mainly through JAK-STAT suppression (20)."

clinical_summary	"Arginine is an amino acid that is synthesized in the body. Oral arginine has been used for various conditions such as hypertension, angina, atherosclerosis, migraine headache, and erectile dysfunction. Its vasodilatory properties are thought to be responsible for the beneficial effects. Arginine has also been used to enhance wound healing, immune function, and athletic performance.

Some studies support the use of arginine in coronary artery and peripheral artery diseases (PADs) (10) (11) (12) (13), but long-term supplementation worsened PAD (14). Arginine has also been studied for its effect on modifying or preventing the development of nitrate tolerance during continuous transdermal nitroglycerin therapy (18). Supplementation with arginine, glutamine, and HMB and may benefit vascular endothelial function in older adults (33), but arginine supplementation did not improve blood flow or muscle performance in older women (34).
Along with antioxidant vitamins, arginine reduced preeclampsia incidence in high-risk women (28), but arginine supplements did not improve blood pressure or kidney function in women with preeclampsia (15). Large doses of oral arginine improved subjective assessment of sexual function in men with erectile dysfunction (16). Arginine combined with ibuprofen may increase pain relief in patients with migraine headaches (17). Arginine supplementation by enteral feeding decreased shock in severely burned patients (4) and may be useful as adjunctive therapy in patients with active tuberculosis (29).

Arginine supplementation has been studied in cancer patients. Perioperative enteral formulas enhanced with arginine may improve wound healing (1), enhance immune status (27), and reduce length of hospital stay (30). Other results in surgical cancer patients have been mixed (35) (36). Interestingly, arginine deprivation-based treatments are also being pursued as potential cancer treatments (31) (32) (37)."
food_sources	Nuts, seeds, soy foods, legumes, and chocolate
mechanism_of_action	Arginine is unique among amino acids for its vasodilatory properties (11). Arginine acts as a precursor for the synthesis of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) via the action of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO functions as a paracrine-signaling molecule mediating vasodilation and inhibition of platelet activation, monocyte and leucocyte adhesion, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO also helps to control vascular oxidative stress and redox-regulated gene expression (22). Arginine is also needed for the synthesis of creatine which is important in muscle contraction (22). In colorectal adenoma cells, arginine reduces the expression of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis, and induces iNOS expression (23).

Studies have shown that spirulina may be effective against allergic rhinitis (5), for managing diabetes (3), and for lowering cholesterol in patients with nephrotic syndrome-induced hyperlipidemia (4). Preliminary data indicate that it may also be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection (19).

Animal studies suggest that spirulina has chemo- and radioprotective effects (6), but human data are lacking.

However, blue-green algae may be contaminated by strains of algae (e.g. Microcystis species) that are toxic."

mechanism_of_action	"Calcium spirulan, a polysaccharide extract from Spirulina platensis, demonstrates inhibition of HIV-1 viral replication via possible binding and disruption of CD4-gp120 interaction in vitro, although the clinical significance of this is unknown (15). Calcium spirulan also inhibits replication of herpes simplex I, cytomegalovirus, and influenza.

Other studies showed that spirulina has chemoprotective and radioprotective effects in animals (6), affected by stimulation of the hemopoietic system.

Although uncommon, several toxins from Microcystis species of algae may contaminate AFA-algae and Spirulina algal blooms. Anatoxin can cause paralysis of respiratory muscles due to irreversible binding and sustained action of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Saxitoxin contamination is thought to block nerve cell neuronal transmission due to binding to voltage-gated sodium channels. Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides that induce hepatotoxicity (9) (10).
Spirulina can significantly inhibit cytochrome P450 1A2 and 2E1 enzymes. The same study showed that it also led to significant increase in mRNA/protein levels of CYP2B1 and CYP3A1, but there was no change in the enzyme activities (20).
Spirulina was shown to antagonize glioma cell growth in mice by down-regulating angiogenesis, which was mediated in part by regulating the production of interleukin (IL-17) (21)."

Preclinical data show that it has anti-inflammatory (15) (16) properties, reduces serum fibrinogen levels, supports fibrinolysis and has also been investigated for its debriding effects on burn wounds (1). A review of clinical findings reported safety and effectiveness of a bromelain based product for burn debridement (28). Small studies also suggest it may be useful for treating skin conditions such as pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) (2); for reducing mild, acute knee pain (3); and for alleviating post-operative pain and swelling (27) (29) (30). But data on bromelain’s pain relieving effects in arthritic patients are mixed (4) (5) (6). A randomized study did not find any benefit in reducing fibrinogen or in influencing other risk factors of cardiovascular disease (31).

Bromelain has been investigated for its anticancer potential as well. It was shown to have chemopreventive (19) (25) and antitumorigenic effects (20) (26), and increased the survival indices of animals bearing leukemia, sarcoma, lung, breast, and ascetic tumors (10). It may be useful as an adjuvant in cancer treatments (7) (8) (9)."
food_sources	Pineapple
mechanism_of_action	"Proteolytic removal of cell surface molecules by bromelain may account for some of its activities. Studies show that it prevents platelet aggregation and adhesion of platelets to blood vessel endothelial cells, as well as improving ischemia-reperfusion injury (13). It can act as an anti-inflammatory agent by reducing levels of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2 (9). In addition, bromelain inhibits neutrophil migration in response to IL-8 during inflammation (14) and decreases pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine secretion (15) (16). Topical application of bromelain may be used for the skin debridement of burns (1).

Oral enzymes such as bromelain have been proposed as additive agents for cancer therapy (8). Proposed mechanisms include down-regulation of the immunosuppressive cytokine, TGF-beta (7), direct inhibition of tumor cell growth, modulation of immune cell function, modulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and the effects on platelet aggregation and thrombosis mentioned above (8) (9). Experiments with murine models showed that bromelain induced apoptosis-related proteins along with inhibiting NF-kappaB-driven Cox-2 expression by blocking the MAPK and Akt/protein kinase B signaling in DMBA-TPA-induced skin tumors (20). Bromelain also induced the expression of autophagy-related proteins, light chain 3 protein B II (LC3BII), and beclin-1 thereby facilitating apoptosis in mammary carcinoma cells (26)."

clinical_summary	"Butterbur is an herb native to Europe, Southwestern Asia, and North Africa, the leaf and root extracts of which have been used to treat allergies, bronchial asthma, headache, pain, and muscle and urinary tract spasms. Petasins, the sesquiterpene compounds found in butterbur, are thought to be the active constituents (1) (2) (3).

Leaf and root extracts of butterbur are effective in controlling migraines in adults and in children (4) (5) (6) (17) (19), and asthma (7). Butterbur extract may also be effective against somatoform disorders (20).
But results from studies on allergic diseases are mixed. Some studies suggest that the efficacy of butterbur extract for allergic rhinitis is comparable to standard antihistamine drugs (8) (9) (10), but conflicting data indicate that it is no better than placebo for intermittent rhinitis (11) or for allergic skin disease (12).

warnings	Calcium may interfere with the absorption of iron, magnesium, and zinc (48) (49). High consumption of calcium has been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (30) (31) (32) (34) (49) (50) and milk-alkali syndrome (51). For those with chronic kidney disease, there is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with calcium supplements (52). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may increase the risk for kidney stones (42) (48) (53) (84). Increasing calcium via diet rather than supplements may lower the risk (54). For those who must take calcium in supplement form, adequate fluid intake is important to help reduce this risk (55).
contraindications	Patients who have hypothyroidism (56), low serum phosphate levels (57), or high serum calcium levels associated with sarcoidosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis D, and certain cancers (49) should consult their physicians before taking calcium supplements.
clinical_summary	"Calcium is an essential mineral responsible for many physiological functions in the body. It is stored in the bones and helps maintain bone structure. Calcium also plays an important role in cell signaling and muscle contraction. Dietary calcium can be found in dairy products, dark greens, legumes, nuts and fish. Natural supplements are derived from minerals, oyster shells and occasionally corals. Calcium can be found in some antacids as well.
The effects of calcium have been studied across a range of conditions including cardiovascular disease (1) (2) (3) (4) (5), osteoporosis (6), bone density loss (7), fracture prevention (8), premenstrual syndrome (9), preeclampsia (10) (11), lead poisoning (12), and various cancers (13) (14) (15).
Long-term calcium supplement use is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery calcification (77). Some studies suggest that calcium supplementation could lead to cardiovascular disease or events (1) (2) (3) (5), but other researchers have not agreed with these conclusions (16) (17) (18). In a Women’s Health Initiative sub-study, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and hormone therapy yielded greater reductions in LDL-C than either intervention alone or placebo (81). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may benefit postmenopausal women who do not have pre-existing risk factors such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension (19) and large long-term studies in women did not find adverse cardiovascular associations with calcium supplementation (4) (20). However, high intakes of calcium supplements did increase cardiovascular mortality in men (21). Another study shows calcium supplement intake is associated with dementia in women after stroke (75).
There is also conflicting evidence on calcium intake or calcium plus vitamin D supplementation on bone density and fractures (22) (23) (24) (42) (53) (82). Recent US Preventive Services Task Force reports found no associations between calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and reduced falls or fracture incidence for community-dwelling older adults without known deficiencies, osteoporosis, or history of fracture (83) (84). In postmenopausal women, neither dietary calcium (25) nor calcium plus vitamin D supplementation (26) reduced hip fracture risk, although the latter study found significant reductions at 7 years (27). Subgroup analysis further suggested that supplementation along with estrogen therapy conferred additive protection against hip fractures (28). However, there appears to be no prevention benefits with calcium and vitamin D supplementation for bone mineral density loss in breast cancer patients (7) or for older adults to help prevent fractures (78). Calcium plus vitamin D mitigated bone density loss associated with antiretroviral therapy (72). In men, bone mineral density and bone loss rates were not related to dietary calcium intake (79).
Both dietary and supplemental calcium are linked with lower risk of colorectal cancer (13) (29), but had no effect on colorectal adenomas (74). For men, calcium intake is associated with increased risk for prostate cancer (30) (31); a genetic disposition for high intestinal absorption of calcium among African-American men has also been noted (32) (33). Long-term studies suggest risks associated with calcium in prostate cancers are less strong when phosphorus intake is also considered (34) (35).
For women, studies on calcium plus vitamin D supplementation to reduce various disease risks are conflicting for colorectal cancers (38) (85), all cancer types (36) (86), and mortality (26) (37). Other studies suggest benefits against hematologic (80) but not invasive cancers (39).
In general, the evidence is insufficient to assess benefits of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation for those receiving androgen deprivation therapy, aromatase inhibitors, or undergoing chemotherapy-induced menopause (7) (43) (44). Patients should consult with their oncologist or oncology healthcare team, especially since calcium supplements can interact with a number of drugs.
A proper diet to achieve a balance among nutrients including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and vitamin D is important to affect risks for hypertension as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (40). The risk–benefit ratio of supplementation is likely to vary, depending on dietary calcium intake, sex, age, ethnicity, and individual risks for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis (41) (73). Intake of high-dose calcium supplements (>1 g/day) can also increase the risk of ischemic stroke (76). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may increase the risk for kidney stones (42) (48) (53) (84)."

mechanism_of_action	"Calcium plays an important role in a variety of muscular, vascular, neurological, hormonal, and enzymatic reactions throughout the body. Calcium reserves are found mostly in the bones, helping to maintain skeletal structure.
The association of supplemental but not dietary calcium with increased cardiovascular risk could be related to their differing, acute effects on serum calcium (45). Calcium supplementation may fail to compensate for renal calcium loss, resulting in increased circulatory calcium that could lead to coronary artery deposits (46). Reduced dietary calcium may cause calcium depletion in membrane storage sites resulting in less stability of vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, as optimal concentrations stabilize these membranes, inhibit calcium entry into cells, and reduce vasoconstriction (47). Other researchers suggest that gastrointestinal events associated with calcium supplements may account for an increase in self-reported cardiovascular events (18).
Observed associations of dairy with overall prostate cancer risk may be related to the modulation of vitamin D metabolism by calcium and phosphorus (15) (31). Saturated fat in whole dairy correlating with higher C-peptide concentrations, along with obesity and hyperinsulinemia are proposed for associations of whole milk with fatal prostate cancer (31). Other suggested mechanisms include increasing levels of ionized calcium in the blood, as prostate cancer cells express both calcium-sensing receptors and calcium-dependent voltage-gated channels, the stimulation of which by extracellular calcium increases prostate cancer cell growth (44) (35). In African American men, positive associations between calcium and aggressive prostate cancer have been linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CDX-2 binding site of the VDR gene (32)."

contraindications	• Cranberry products can increase urine oxalate excretion and may promote the formation of the most common type of kidney stones (32) (33) (40). Its use should therefore be limited in patients with a history of nephrolithiasis (40).
clinical_summary	"Cranberry is an evergreen shrub that is grown in North America and Europe. The processed fruit and juice, both rich in vitamin C, are widely consumed as food. The juice extract is marketed as a dietary supplement for urinary tract health and to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). It has also been used for oral and gastrointestinal infections, cardiovascular diseases, and against cancer. In preclinical studies, cranberry juice extracts and constituents exhibited antibacterial (1), antimicrobial (45), antifungal (46), anti-inflammatory (47), antioxidant (48), and antiadherence (49) properties.
Clinical studies demonstrate that cranberry extracts can help prevent UTIs in adults (2) (3), children (4), in prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy (5) (50), and in patients following urostomy (68). A large double-blind study of older adults with high-baseline UTI risk also showed benefit (51), but another similar study reported negative findings (52). A subsequent analysis revealed increased costs with no meaningful reduction in UTI rates in a geriatric nursing home environment (53). Studies of cranberry juice for recurrent UTIs have also been mixed, with one study finding no benefit among college-aged women (6), and another observing significant reductions in UTI relapse in women over age 50 (54). Cranberry was not as effective or cost-effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in preventing UTIs in premenopausal women, but patients were less likely to develop antibiotic-resistant bacteria (8) (55). In volunteers from different regions, anti-adhesion activity with cranberry powder was found to be dose-dependent (7) . Overall, a systematic review determined that cranberry juice was more effective than capsules or tablets  (56), but despite some support for recurrent UTI prophylaxis (69), there is not enough evidence to recommend cranberry juice for UTI prevention (9) (70).
In other studies, cranberry juice inhibited the adhesion of H. pylori to human gastric mucosa (18), and regular consumption may suppress H. pylori infection (19) (20), a major factor in peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. When used with standard treatment, cranberry juice helped eradicate H. pylori (21). It was shown to prevent plaque formation and the development of gum disease as well due to its anticolonizing and antiadhesion properties (22) (23).
Cranberry extracts and proanthocyanidins also exhibited antiproliferative effects against prostate (10) (11) (12), liver (13), lung (57), neuroblastoma (58), breast (14), ovarian (15), gastric (59), colon (12) (16), esophageal (60), and oral (12) cancer cells. Although cranberry juice consumption did not lower oxidative status in humans, suggesting lack of protective effect against cancer or heart disease (17), it did appear to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in diabetic men (61). However, cranberry juice has high concentrations of oxalate, a common component of kidney stones, and should be limited in patients with a history of nephrolithiasis (40). Other data suggest it may be helpful in uncommon forms including struvite stones, which are associated with bladder infections (33) (62) (63)."
food_sources	Cranberry can be consumed as juice, sauce, or dried fruit.
mechanism_of_action	"The A-type linkages in cranberry proanthocyanidins C-PACs may enhance urinary bacterial antiadhesion activities to prevent UTIs (25) (26) (27) (28) (64). Similarly, the bioactivity against C. albicans biofilm formation is due to anti-adherence properties and/or iron chelation (46). In susceptible populations, improved preventive effects with cranberry juice over capsules or tablets may be related to better hydration with liquid, and/or additive effects with additional compounds in juice not contained in supplements (56). Anti-adhesion properties were also demonstrated in other microenvironments. Cranberry prevented H. pylori-induced stomach ulcers by inhibiting bacterial adhesions in the stomach lining (18) (29), decreased adherence of oral streptococci strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (23) and glucan-coated hydroxyapatite, and impaired biofilm formation (22) (30) indicating it may slow development of dental plaque and protect against plaque-related diseases. Cranberry also regulated aggressive human periodontitis fibroblast inflammatory responses via nuclear factor-kappaB and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) inhibition (47).
Additional studies have shown that C-PACs may play a role in enhancing host innate immunity. In a worm model, a standardized cranberry extract mediated host immune response via p38 MAPK signaling, insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling, and heat shock factor 1 (45). Antiatherogenic effects of cranberry juice occur via reductions in serum glucose and apoB, and increases in serum and apoA-1 and paraoxonase, associated with stabilizing HDL (61).
Mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of cranberry extracts and C-PACs have also been investigated. A cranberry extract inhibited prostate cancer cell growth by decreasing cyclins, cyclin-dependant kinase expression (10) , and MMP activity (31). Dose-response inhibition of gastric cancer cells to cranberry is in part due to decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and apoptotic induction (59). A proanthocyanidin isolate was shown to arrest ovarian cancer cell growth by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor and generating reactive oxygen species (15). C-PACs were also found to induce cell death in esophageal adenocarcinoma via microRNA modifications within cancer cells (60), and in human lung cancer cells, they altered gene expression, induced apoptosis, and modulated cell-cycle processes (57). In high-risk neuroblastoma cells, a purified C-PAC induced apoptosis and ROS generation, and encouraged cyclophosphamide retention with synergistic cytotoxic benefits (58).
Cranberry juice increases the risk of uric acid stone formation because of its acidifying effect and slowing of urate synthesis, thereby decreasing urinary pH (32) (33)."

contraindications	Avoid use during pregnancy or if lactating due to risk of toxicity and potential GI distress (24). Since elderberry may strengthen or modulate the immune system (7), it should be avoided in patients with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and lupus, or those taking immunosuppressants.
clinical_summary	"Elderberry belongs to a family of flowering shrubs known as Sambucus or Elder. They are native to Europe but have become naturalized in many parts of the world including the United States. Cultivated for medicinal and food purposes, the fruit is used to produce jams, syrups, and wine. Elderberry flowers and fruit are incorporated in remedies to reduce cold and flu symptoms, for inflammation and respiratory diseases (1) (2) (3), and as a laxative (4). The berries are a rich source of anthocyanins and other phenolics and nutrients (2). Several species of Sambucus produce elderberries with similar chemical compositions including American Elder (Sambucus canadensis) and Blue Elder (Sambucus caerulea) (1), but European Elder (Sambucus nigra) is the type most studied and used in supplements.
In vitro studies demonstrate that elderberries possess antiviral (5), antibacterial (3), antidiabetic (6), immunomodulatory (7), antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventive properties (1) (2) (8), although inhibition of cancer cell growth was shown to be weak (9). Flavonoids and proanthocyanidins were shown to block HIV1 infection, and may have additive effects with existing HIV drugs such as enfuvirtide (10). Elderberry also conferred protective effects against oxidative stressors in endothelial cells (8). However, in vitro studies did not find it to be vasoprotective (11) and randomized trials found it ineffective for both cardiovascular disease biomarkers (12) and improving cholesterol levels (13). Small randomized trials found that elderberry significantly reduced influenza symptoms (14), and was safe and effective in a preparation for chronic constipation (4), but more studies are needed before any conclusions can be drawn.
Unsubstantiated claims that elderberry prevents or treats various diseases including AIDS, diabetes and flu have recently been halted by the FDA (15). This is particularly important as patients may forego or avoid legitimate treatments."
food_sources	
mechanism_of_action	Elderberry inhibits H1N1 activities by binding to H1N1 virions and blocking host cell recognition and entry (5). It may also prevent HIV1 infection by binding to viral glycoproteins such as gp120 (10), but additional investigations are required to clarify those mechanisms (3). Elderberry’s anti-inflammatory effects may result from increased cytokine production (19) or inhibition of nuclear transcription factor kappaB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (20). An elderberry extract improved metabolic disturbances in a murine model of obesity by lowering serum triglycerides, inflammatory markers and insulin resistance (30). Its antidiabetic properties occur via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and stimulation of insulin-dependent glucose uptake (6). Elderberry may also influence HDL dysfunction associated with chronic inflammation by affecting hepatic gene expression in hyperlipidemic mice (31). Another study indicates its chemopreventive potential is related to induction of quinone reductase as well as cyclooxygenase-2 and ornithine decarboxylase inhibition (2).

contraindications	Fenugreek acts as an estrogen receptor modulator and was shown to stimulate breast cancer cells in vitro (26). Patients with hormonal-sensitive cancers should consult their physicians before using fenugreek.
clinical_summary	"Fenugreek is derived from the dried seeds of the plant and is used in ayurvedic medicine as a demulcent, laxative, and as a galactagogue. It is also used as a dietary supplement to treat various conditions including diabetes, high cholesterol, wounds, inflammation, and gastrointestinal complaints. In vitro and animal studies indicate that fenugreek has hypocholesterolemic (1), hypolipidemic (2) (23), hypoglycemic (3), antimicrobial (20), hepatoprotective (5) (6) effects, and may be effective in reducing peripheral neuropathy (30).
Small studies suggest benefits of fenugreek against mild asthma (33), for alleviating menopausal (34) and postmenopausal (35) symptoms; and against polycystic ovary syndrome (42). It was also reported to improve glycemic control and to decrease insulin resistance in mild type-2 diabetic patients (36), but well-designed studies are needed to confirm these observations (37).

In other studies, fenugreek demonstrated chemopreventive properties against certain cancers (7) (8) (9) (24), and reduced the toxicity associated with buthionine sulfoximine and cyclophosphamide in mice (25). Human studies have not yet been conducted. Fenugreek acts as an estrogen receptor modulator and stimulates breast cancer cells in vitro (26). But evidence of its potential to stimulate lactation is limited."
food_sources	
mechanism_of_action	"The hypoglycemic activity of fenugreek may be associated with the galactomannan fiber and saponin components that reduce gastrointestinal glucose and cholesterol absorption, and increase bile acid excretion (14); computational analyses also revealed galactomannan as a potential drug candidate against type-2 diabetes and breast cancer (38). 4-Hydroxyisoleucine, an amino acid constituent of fenugreek, potentiates insulin secretion in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDD) rats when administered intraperitoneally (15). In addition to lower fasting and postprandial glucose levels, fenugreek-treated diabetic rats have higher hemoglobin, GSH, and plasma antioxidant levels and lower glycosylated hemoglobin, plasma lipids, and TBARS levels than diabetic controls (4). Dietary fenugreek also normalizes the activities of glucose and lipid-metabolizing enzymes in diabetic rats (3). Studies using healthy mice and rats indicate that dietary fenugreek is associated with increased serum T4, liver GSH, glyoxalase I, and GST activities, and decreased T3 levels and T3/T4 ratio (17) (18) (19). Fenugreek intake in humans was associated with an increase in molar insulin binding sites of erythrocytes, which may enhance glucose utilization (16).
Fenugreek has been studied for its anticancer potential. In MCF-7 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, a fenugreek extract induced cell cycle arrest as well as apoptosis (9). Dioscin, a steroidal saponin isolated from fenugreek, was shown to suppress cell viability of ovarian cancer cells by regulating the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (39)."

adverse_reactions	Allergic reactions including rhinorrhea, wheezing, numbness of head, facial angioedema and fainting were reported following inhalation and external application of fenugreek seed powder (31). Excessive use of fenugreek milk porridge was reported to cause severe coagulation failure in a patient with compensation cirrhosis (40). Fenugreek seed extract caused developmental abnormalities in mice (27), but this has not been shown in humans. A fenugreek seed extract was found to improve insulin secretion and decrease glucose level, but impaired the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT), in diabetic rats.

contraindications	Because flaxseed has phytoestrogenic effects, patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer should use flaxseed with caution.
clinical_summary	"Flaxseed has been used in traditional medicine to treat coughs, colds, constipation, and urinary tract infections. It has also been used as a topical demulcent and as an emollient, and is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and phytoestrogenic lignans.
Flaxseed improved mild menopausal symptoms (11) and was shown to have chemoprotective effects in postmenopausal women (2). It may benefit women with polycystic ovarian syndrome by reducing androgen levels (23), and a moderate reduction of estrogens and androgens was also seen in postmenopausal women (24). However, lignan supplementation was ineffective in reducing hot flashes in postmenopausal women with or without breast cancer (28). Flaxseed powder along with Vitex agnus may help to reduce cyclical mastalgia (39).
Supplementation with a major lignan derived from flaxseed improved glycemic control in Type-2 diabetic patients (13). Flaxseed products have also been shown to reduce blood pressure (1) (34) (40) (41). In prediabetic patients, daily flaxseed powder lowered blood pressure but did not improve insulin resistance or glycemic indices (35).
In other studies, flaxseed supplementation plus lifestyle modification was more effective than lifestyle modification alone to manage metabolic syndrome (36) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (37). In hemodialysis patients, daily flaxseed oil consumption significantly reduced inflammatory markers related to cardiovascular disease (38). Although flaxseed-derived lignan reduces blood glucose levels in hypercholesterolemic individuals (14), data on the cholesterol-lowering effects of flaxseed are mixed (11) (15) (26). Flaxseed conferred renoprotection in patients with lupus nephritis (3), but additional study is needed.
Flaxseed has been investigated for its anticancer potential. Laboratory studies suggest it may inhibit growth and metastasis of human breast (6) (29) and prostate (7) cancers as well as melanoma (8). Other animal studies suggest it may reduce radiation therapy-induced lung damage and improve survival (27).
In human studies, flaxseed lowered tumor biomarkers in men with prostate cancer (9) (25) and patients with breast cancer (10), but a flaxseed extract was ineffective in preventing oral infection following radiation treatment for head and neck cancer (12).
Flaxseed ingestion can increase urinary lignan excretion (4) and the length of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (5)."
food_sources	
mechanism_of_action	"Flaxseed is the most concentrated food source of the plant lignan, secoisolariciresinol, a precursor for enterolactone. It is thought that phytoestrogenic lignans contribute to the plant’s hormonal effects (4). Flaxseed has been shown to affect the length of the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women (5). It may also alter estrogen metabolism, increasing the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrogen to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone in a dose-dependent fashion (2). Flaxseed’s renoprotective effects are thought to be via high concentration of alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid precursor (3) or through inhibition of angiogenesis, tyrosine protein kinases, and cytokine-induced activation of transcription factors (16). The laxative effects of flaxseed are likely due to its fiber content (22).
Animal studies suggest growth and metastasis inhibition of established human breast cancer with flaxseed is due in part to downregulation of insulin-like growth factor I and expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (6). Flaxseed also induced apoptosis by significantly upregulating p53 mRNA in breast cancer cell lines (29). In another study, flaxseed oil enhanced effects of trastuzumab in reducing HER2 signaling via Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, resulting in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (33). Inhibition of cell proliferation in models of prostate cancer were also shown with flaxseed (7).
In human studies, dietary flaxseed reduces central aortic blood pressure through changes in plasma oxylipins (40) (41). Other studies suggest hormonal effects may play a role in the ability of flaxseed to modulate prostate cancer biology and associated biomarkers (9), and lower serum lipid levels in postmenopausal breast cancer (10)."

clinical_summary	"Folate is an essential member of the vitamin B complex family that is naturally available in grains, green leafy vegetables, and liver. Folic acid and the L-methylfolate (5-MTHF) derivative are synthetic supplemental forms that have higher bioavailability (1). Folate is important in cell growth and division and involved in the methylation process and DNA synthesis. Inadequate intake can cause deficiency leading to megaloblastic anemia.
Folate is essential during pregnancy. Supplementation has been shown to reduce risks of neural tube birth defects (10) and medulloblastoma in offspring (11). One study among South American populations suggests the protective effect against neural tube defects may be greater in female than male infants (65). In high doses (5 mg/day), it reduced homocysteine levels at time of delivery and may lessen pregnancy complications (43). Folate supplementation may benefit women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (42). High folate intake also reduced chromosomal aberrations in sperm of healthy men (12).
In other studies, folic acid decreased homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality (13) (14) (15), and reduced blood pressure in smokers (5) (16). Among hypertensive adults, folic acid therapy reduced risk of first stroke (44) (45) (66), but smoking status may affect efficacy (67). Other trials on stroke risk have yielded mixed results (17) (18) (19) (20).
Folic acid supplementation improved cognitive function in older adults (26). In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, it improved response to cholinesterase inhibitors (27), cognition, and inflammatory markers (46). In individuals chronically exposed to arsenic, it lowered blood arsenic concentrations by facilitating urinary excretion (28). There is limited evidence on whether folic acid supplementation can increase serum folate levels, or have an effect on anemia in patients with sickle cell disease (68).
Studies on increased folate intake or supplements to reduce cancer risk are mixed. In young children, folic acid fortification was associated with reduced incidence of Wilms tumor and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) (36). Folate supplementation also helps cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) regression (47). Low levels of folate in the blood are associated with certain forms of cancer (9), whereas higher levels of dietary folate have been shown to reduce the risk of breast (2) and pancreatic cancers (3), but not prostate cancer (7). Studies on colorectal cancer risk produced mixed results (4) (5) (32) (35) (48) and some even suggest a negative effect (6) (8) (49). A large population study suggests an association between dietary folate intake and increased risk for overall skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and nonmelanoma skin cancer, particularly in women (50).
Overconsumption of folic acid may increase risk of toxicity (51) and some cancers (52). Therefore, more research is needed to examine the relationships between folate levels, supplementation, and cancer risks or prevention.
Studies that evaluate folic acid in combination with other B vitamins are largely negative, with no overall effect on breast or invasive cancers  (33), and the potential for increased cancer incidence and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease  (34). Such interventions have also produced mixed results in studies for older adults with depression  (53) (54), and did not improve bone mineral density (55) or reduce fracture risk or incidence (56) (69).
Due to its antagonistic effects, folic acid can reduce the side effects of methotrexate when used for rheumatoid arthritis (22) (23). However, it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (24) and psoriasis (25). Excess folate or folic acid may mask vitamin B12 deficiency  (70)."
food_sources	Main sources include fortified breakfast cereals and breads, liver, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, spinach, chickpeas, and brewer’s yeast.
mechanism_of_action	"The bioactive form of folate is tetrahydrofate, which can be converted from folic acid through the action of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Drugs that inhibit this enzyme can reduce folic acid activity. Folate acts as a co-enzyme in the methylation process. The amino acid serine reacts with tetrahydrofolate, resulting in 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate, the derivative involved in nucleotide synthesis. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate transfers a methyl group to cobalamin (vitamin B12) and then to homocysteine, converting it to methionine. Methionine is the precursor of the methyl donor, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe), which plays a major role in neurological function and several biochemical pathways (41). Genetic polymorphisms that lowered the production of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) can also reduce SAMe and increase homocysteine levels. Supplementation with folic acid can reduce homocysteine levels and DNA oxidative damage (57) (58). This may in turn lower risks for cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases by increasing SAMe (59) (60). Folic acid supplementation also improves endothelial function (16) (31).
Although low folate status is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some cancers (61), increased intake from fortified foods may actually raise cancer risk (49) (50) (62). There is also evidence that high levels of unmetabolized folic acid in plasma can reduce natural killer cell cytotoxicity (63)."

clinical_summary	"Ginkgo biloba is one of the oldest living tree species. It is cultivated around the world for its medicinal properties and aesthetic value. The seeds and leaves have been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat respiratory diseases, circulatory disorders, sexual dysfunction, and hearing loss. In vitro, ginkgo extracts exhibit chemopreventive (1), anticancer (2), and cytotoxic (3) effects.
Although marketed for memory improvement, clinical studies including the large Gingko Evaluation of Memory (GEM) study generally show supplementation with ginkgo does not improve cognitive performance or prevent Alzheimer’s disease or dementia (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . In addition, positive effects from earlier studies were not confirmed in more recent trials and some systematic reviews determined there was insufficient evidence on any benefits in adults with either normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment (9) (10).
Although two trials suggest potential benefit with gingko in patients who had an acute ischemic stroke (11) (12), a study in older adults noted increased stroke incidence in the ginkgo group versus placebo (4). In addition, the large GEM study did not find benefit with ginkgo for cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality (13). Several studies indicate that ginkgo is not beneficial for tinnitus (14) (15).
Studies on using ginkgo for ADHD in children (16) (17) and for mountain sickness (18) (19) yielded mixed results.
Preliminary epidemiological and biological data suggest ginkgo may reduce ovarian cancer risk (20). Orally administered capsules of ginkgo exocarp polysaccharides reduced the tumor area in a small study of patients with gastric cancer (3). An injectable form of ginkgo extract and 5-flurouracil administered to advanced colorectal cancer patients demonstrated benefit with the combination therapy (21). However, secondary outcome data from the aforementioned GEM study does not support the use of gingko to reduce cancer risk (22). It is also ineffective in preventing chemotherapy-associated cognitive dysfunction in breast cancer patients (23).
Interestingly, high doses of a ginkgo extract showed hepatocarcinogenic effects in a murine model (24) (25). More studies are needed to determine the significance of these findings."

Ginkgo may play a role in decreasing high-glucose-induced endothelial inflammation via inhibition of interleukin-6 activation (28), and repeated intake of ginkgo enhanced cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation (29). Flavonoids present in ginkgo extracts inhibited estrogen biosynthesis via aromatase inhibition, decreased CYP19 mRNA, and induced transcriptional suppression (30).
Chemopreventive properties of bilobalide, a terpene trilactone, may occur via alterations in cryptal cell proliferation and drug-metabolizing enzyme activities (1).

clinical_summary	"Hops are the female inflorescences of the plant Humulus lupulus L. They are used primarily in beer brewing to add bitterness and flavor. Hops is also used as an herbal medicine for mood disturbance and insomnia (1) and to treat menopausal symptoms. In vitro studies have shown that hops has chemopreventive (2), (3), (4) antitumor (5), antiangiogenic (6), anti-inflammatory (19) and antidiabetic (7) properties. Hops also reduces hyperlipidemia (8) and obesity (9) in mice.

In human studies, a hops-valerian combination product improved sleep quality (10) (16), and insulin sensitivity in patients with type-2 diabetes (7). Data from an observational study suggest benefits of a combination of hops, rosemary extract and oleanolic acid in reducing arthritic pain (11). However, it is not clear whether hops alone would exert similar effects.
A hops extract was shown to alleviate menopausal symptoms (13) (17), and may improve bone health (18) in postmenopausal women.

mechanism_of_action	"Isomerized hops extracts (IHEs) increase plasma HDL levels and decrease atherosclerosis index (AI) in mice on high fat, high cholesterol diet via PPAR-alpha activation (14). These extracts also reduced plasma triglyceride levels and induced hepatomegaly (8). Other studies show IHE rich in isohumulone can inhibit PGE2 production and reduce the formation aberrant crypt foci in the colon of mice. Xanthohumol, a flavonoid from hop exhibits antiangiogenic effect by inhibiting the NF-kB and Akt pathway (6). A product containing hops extract reduces levels of C-reactive protein in patients with inflammatory diseases (12).
Prenyl flavonoids from hops, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, and 8-prenylnaringen (8-PN) inhibit aromatase activity and breast cancer cell proliferation, and increase breast cancer cell apoptosis in vitro (5). They also inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro (3). However, isoxanthohumols are converted in the distal human gut into the phytoestrogen 8-prenylnaringen (8-PN) via the action of intestinal microflora (12). This process also occurs in the liver and is regulated by the cytochrome P450 enzymes (15)."

In addition, preliminary experiments suggest I3C may potentiate or have sensitizing effects in combination with bortezomib (25) (47), tamoxifen (48), doxorubicin (49) (50), vemurafenib (51), fludarabine (52), gemcitabine (24) (43), or acetylsalicylic acid (53), and may reverse cytotoxicity with dexamethasone (54) or cardiotoxicity with doxorubicin (50) . However, these effects have not been confirmed in humans. Studies in animal carcinogenesis models suggest that I3C may also promote tumor growth (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) (61). Additional studies are needed to determine under what conditions I3C could be a suitable chemopreventive agent in humans.
Data from early phase clinical trials suggested that I3C is effective against precancerous cervical dysplasia (2) and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (3). In premenopausal women, a supplement containing I3C and 7-hydroxymatairesinol, a dietary ingredient, increased the urinary 2:16-hydroxyestrone ratio, a known biomarker for the reduction of breast cancer risk (4). More recently, an RCT of a diindolylmethane formulation (DIM, an active I3C metabolite) in breast cancer patients on tamoxifen suggest it encourages beneficial changes in estrogen metabolism and circulating sex hormone-binding globulin levels (67).
I3C is generally well tolerated when taken orally, but it is unclear if I3C supplementation can benefit humans due to its mixed effects in preliminary studies and its ability to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes (14) (62), which may cause interactions with several medications. In addition, a recent study to measure Brassica consumption in humans suggests that the chemopreventive effects derived from cruciferous vegetable consumption may plateau and not require eating large quantities or taking high-dose supplements (68)."

mechanism_of_action	"Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a natural indolecarbinol compound derived from the breakdown of glucobrassicin produced in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts (39). Some of the health-protective effects of I3C are attributed to epigenetic mechanisms such as the regulation of HDAC and HAT activities and acetylation of histones and non-histone chromatin proteins (63).
Preliminary studies suggest several benefits to immune function. I3C counteracted immune evasion mechanisms of HPV16 by antagonizing E6 repression of E-cadherin (64). It decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and T cell activation by acting as histone deacetylase class I (HDAC-I) inhibitors (31). Other anti-inflammatory mechanisms include regulation of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent signaling pathways (30).
In cancer cells, I3C at higher doses (>400 μM) induced apoptosis, while lower doses (<200 μM) inihbited cell growth as well as cyclin E and CDK2 expression (27). It is among compounds that exert antiproliferative and/or proapoptotic effects through regulation of one or more microRNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or translation repression (65).
I3C may act as a chemopreventive agent for breast cancer through its estrogen receptor (ER) modulating effect (15) or upregulation of apoptotic enzyme activities (48). It disrupted ER alpha-mediated transcription within IGF1 cascade cell signaling components (34), downregulated expression of estrogen-responsive genes pS2 and cathepsin-D, and upregulated BRAC1 (17). Other inhibitory mechanisms include suppressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Sp1-mediated gene transcription, reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities, and decreasing aromatase expression (16) (36) (37). One randomized clinical trial suggests that the decreased risk of ER-sensitive breast and cervical cancers with I3C may be due to an increase in the 2-OH-estrone:estriol metabolite ratio (18).
In HepG2 cells, I3C induced phase II and antioxidant enzymes (41). Other hepatoprotective mechanisms include immunomodulation and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (66). Acute hepatic inflammation was suppressed via decreased miR-31 expression and subsequent caspase-2-dependent apoptosis in T cells (32). In human lung carcinoma A549 cells, I3C significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase (12). In murine models, chemopreventive effects against lung tumors occurred via reductions in levels of proinflammatory and procarcinogenic proteins (44). In melanoma cells, I3C induced G1-phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by stabilization of PTEN that express wild-type PTEN (39). In prostate cancer cells, I3C inhibits androgen-dependent pathways and appeared to block the inflammatory microenvironment (38), and caused apoptosis by inhibiting Akt activation (8).
I3C coadministration with doxorubicin potentiated cytotoxic effects compared with either agent alone in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (49). Chemosensitive effects were produced in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells via microRNA-21 downregulation (43). I3C also lowered the LD50 of gemcitabine and decreased growth of pancreatic cancer cells, possibly through reactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a (19). I3C with genistein produced synergy of apotosis and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in endometrial cancer cells (40). It reversed dexamethasone cytotoxicity via ROS inhibition and enhanced nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression (54).
Some animal studies suggest that I3C is both an inhibitor and promoter of carcinogenesis with strong induction of placental glutathione S-transferase foci in the liver (57), and modulatory activity that included apoptotic inhibition in colon tumors (55). In addition, I3C may promote endometrial adenocarcinoma through hepatic CYP1 induction and estrogen metabolism modulation (56)."

clinical_summary	"Kudzu is a botanical used in Chinese medicine to treat alcoholism, menopausal symptoms, diabetes mellitus, fever, common cold, and neck or eye pain. There are several species of Kudzu and both the flowers and root extract are used for their medicinal properties. Isoflavones, the major components of kudzu, are thought to be responsible for the beneficial effects.
Kudzu demonstrated antiproliferative (1), anti-inflammatory (3), and neuroprotective (16) (18) properties. It also has antiapoptotic effects against ethanol-induced apoptosis and suppresses alcohol intake (4).

Small studies indicate benefits of kudzu in reducing alcohol intake in heavy drinkers (9) (19) (23). Data also indicate that it does not affect the sleep cycle of moderate drinkers (20). Kudzu may improve symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats in perimenopausal women (5) (10) (21), and cognitive function in postmenopausal women (6). It may also be effective in preventing the development of gray hair (24).
However, because it has estrogenic effects (11), individuals with hormone-sensitive cancers and those taking tamoxifen should avoid kudzu."

mechanism_of_action	"Isoflavones present in Pueraria mirifica are thought to be involved in alleviating symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats in perimenopausal women (5) and affect cognitive function in postmenopausal women (6). The isoflavones present in the root extract suppress alcohol intake and alcohol withdrawal symptoms in mice although the mechanism is unclear (4). The anti-inflammatory property of kudzu is attributed to its ability to decrease prostaglandin E2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha release, both of which are involved in inflammatory process (3). The flowers of Pueraria thunbergiana exhibit protective effects against ethanol-induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting the expression of a protease, caspase-3 that is responsible for proteolytic cleavage of many proteins (7).
Peurarin may alleviate chronic alcoholic liver injury in rats via inhibition of endotoxin gut-leakage, activation of Kupffer cells, and expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptors (22).
Tectorigenin, an isoflavone present in kudzu, demonstrated antiproliferative activity against human cancer (HL-60) cells. The proposed mechanisms are induction of differentiation in the cells and a reduction in the expression of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein (1)."

warnings	Melatonin may cause drowsiness. Patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery until familiar with the effects of melatonin.
contraindications	
clinical_summary	"Melatonin is produced endogenously in humans by the pineal gland. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is thought to control the circadian pacemaker and promote sleep (1). Small amounts of melatonin are found in fruits, nuts, olive oil, and wine. The supplemental form is used as a sleep-aid.
Clinical studies suggest that melatonin may decrease sleep latency and improve sleep duration (2) (3) (4), although randomized trials have produced mixed data (27) (28) (29). A meta-analysis did not find any significant effects with melatonin on secondary sleep disorders associated with medical, neurological, or substance abuse disorders (5), but supplementation was reported to improve subjective sleep quality in patients with traumatic brain injury (44). Additional studies show that melatonin may decrease surgery-associated anxiety and pain (6) as well as frequency of migraine attacks (7). Systematic reviews indicate that it can reduce perioperative anxiety (30), but there is insufficient evidence for its use to improve sleep in ICU patients (46), depression or depressive symptoms (47), or for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) (48). It also did not improve nocturia in a small study of multiple sclerosis patients (53). A few studies suggest melatonin may be helpful for jet lag (51) (52). Studies on whether melatonin can help in benzodiazepine withdrawal are mixed (49) (50).
In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that melatonin has antioxidant (38) (39) and antiproliferative properties, including against breast cancer cells (40); synergistic effects with anticancer agents (8) (9) (32); and protective effects against adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity (33).
Clinical trials evaluating melatonin as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents and in patients with solid tumors suggest improvements in quality of life and survival time (10) (11) (12) (13), but melatonin did not improve appetite, weight, or quality of life in cancer patients with cachexia (35). In studies of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, short-term supplementation did not influence estradiol levels (36) but improved sleep quality (37). A meta-analyses suggests melatonin may help reduce incidence of some chemotherapy side effects including thrombocytopenia, asthenia, and neurotoxicity (54). A case report suggests that use of oral melatonin may delay menopause in pre-menopausal women by modulating levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen (31)."
food_sources	Small amounts of melatonin are found in fruits, nuts, olive oil and wine.
mechanism_of_action	"Melatonin is an endogenously produced indolamine hormone secreted by the pineal gland in humans. Nocturnal secretion is regulated by circadian rhythms and nighttime darkness (17), and melatonin is thought to control the circadian pacemaker and promote sleep. Ironically, it is associated with wakefulness and activity in nocturnal animals (14). As levels of melatonin increase, an associated drop in core body temperature occurs. Both elderly and depressed patients tend to have lower basal levels of melatonin (2).
Melatonin is a free-radical scavenger (18) (38) and enhances antioxidative enzyme activities (39), interacting with cytosolic calmodulin and stimulating IL-4 production in bone marrow T-lymphocytes (1). In vitro and animal studies suggest that antitumor effects may occur through antimitotic or immunomodulatory activity. In vitro studies demonstrate antiproliferative effects on human breast cancer (HS578T) (19) and mouse melanoma (B16BL6, PG19) (8). Decreases in breast cancer metastasis may occur via modulation of Rho-associated kinase protein-1 expression (41). Melatonin reduces proliferation of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in mice, but has no effect on apoptosis (9). Its effect on tumor cell growth may be mediated in part by melatonin receptor signaling (20) (21). In endometrial cancer cells, it interferes with estrogen receptor expression (22). Other laboratory studies suggest that melatonin behaves both as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and as an aromatase inhibitor (42) (43). In a murine model, it modulated expression of genes crucial for DNA repair — Ogg1, Apex1, and Xrcc1 — in peripheral blood cells, to reduce X-ray-induced DNA damage  (45)."

clinical_summary	"N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that is used as a prescription drug and as a dietary supplement. As a drug, it is given parenterally or orally to treat acetaminophen overdose. The inhalant and oral solution forms have a mucolytic effect to relieve obstructions in bronchial diseases and in tracheotomy procedures. The oral capsule is marketed as a dietary supplement for its liver protective function and is popular among patients with AIDS and cancer.
Clinical studies show NAC can treat drug-induced hepatotoxicity (1) (2), prevent and treat conditions of oxidative stress and reduce GSH levels caused by diseases such as HIV/AIDS (3) and cancer (4), and alleviate toxicity from chemo- and radiotherapy (4).
Results for treatment of chronic lung disease with NAC are mixed. NAC reduces the number of acute exacerbations in patients with chronic bronchopulmonary disease (5) and significantly improves lung function and endurance in COPD patients after exercise (6), but benefits were not observed in other trials (7) (8), including a study of high-dose NAC (37). In cystic fibrosis patients, long-term oral NAC maintained lung function but had no effect on biomarkers of neutrophilic inflammation (38). NAC was not helpful for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and did not alter the tolerability profile of pirfenidone (39); nor was it helpful for Lou Gehrig’s disease (10).
Oral NAC reduced oxidative stress and preserved renal function in hemodialysis patients (40) (41).
NAC has glutamate modulating effects (11) and has been tested as a treatment for psychiatric disorders (12) including addictions (13) and substance abuse (11). It also reduced symptoms of trichotillomania (14) .
Studies in smokers (15) and patients with a history of adenomatous colonic polyps (16) show NAC inhibits cancer biomarker development, although it did not inhibit the formation of secondary head and neck or lung tumors (17). In addition, NAC accelerated lung cancer growth in an animal model (36).
Preliminary studies suggest oral NAC may help reduce chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (18), but a single oral dose of NAC did not protect moles from UV-induced oxidative stress (42). In leukemia patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic SCT preceded by high-dose chemotherapy, parenteral NAC reduced incidence and duration oral mucositis (43).
Gastrointestinal side effects from the consumption of NAC have been reported (19). Due to its antioxidant activity, it may interfere with the actions of some chemotherapy drugs."
food_sources	Food is not a significant source of N-acetylcysteine.
mechanism_of_action	"NAC is a precursor to glutathione (GSH). It is used as both an antidote for acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and as a mucolytic agent for respiratory diseases. NAC reduces disulphide bonds to sulfhydryl bonds to reduce mucus formation (20). Its hepatoprotective action may occur by cytokine-mediated mechanisms as well as GSH replenishment (21). In animal studies, NAC exhibits chemopreventive effects against lung (22), hepatocellular (23), esophageal (24), and immune system (25) cancers.
An in vitro study shows NAC may improve the benefit of ifosfamide by decreasing the risk of nephrotoxicity without interfering with the agent’s antitumor effect (26). Another study finds that NAC alters doxorubicin-induced NF-κB activity via concentration-dependent anti- and pro-oxidant mechanisms (27). This biphasic effect is also time-dependent (28). In androgen-independent human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, NAC has an antiproliferative effect by upregulating Cyr61 protein expression (28).
NAC amide can increase bioavailability and reduce oxidative stress, but it does not decrease doxorubicin-induced cell death in H9c2 cardiomyocytes (29). In an animal study, NAC increased lung cancer cell proliferation due to its antioxidant activity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and p53 expression (36).
NAC crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases the brain GSH levels. NAC acts as a glutamine modulator (11) and plays a role in treating psychiatry disorders (12)."

contraindications	
clinical_summary	"Pomegranate is a small fruit-bearing tree native to Asia, but it is also cultivated in many parts of the world including the United States. The fruit juice extracted from the arils of the seeds is used in drinks and as a dietary supplement. Several studies have shown that pomegranate has antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic properties which are attributed to the presence of multiple polyphenols such as tannins, flavonols, anthocyanins, and ellagic acid (1) (2).
Consumption of pomegranate juice was found to benefit patients with carotid artery stenosis (6), hypertension (7), hyperlipidemia (21), or mild to moderate erectile dysfunction (19), as well as patients with coronary heart disease (8), but had no effect in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (9). A systematic review determined the evidence on pomegranate supplementation for blood pressure management is limited (34). In a study of postmenopausal women, intake of pomegranate seed oil did not reduce hot flashes (22).
In preclinical studies, pomegranate juice suppressed inflammatory cell signaling (1), inhibited prostate tumor growth, and lowered serum PSA levels (3) (4). It also inhibited aromatase activity, endogenous estrogen biosynthesis, and breast cancer cell proliferation (5). A pomegranate seed extract alleviated ciplatin-induced hepatotoxicity in animal studies (23).
In prostate cancer patients, the safety and utility of pomegranate has been studied neoadjuvantly, during active surveillance or with biochemical recurrence, and in those with advanced cancer. Pomegranate extract before surgery resulted in pomegranate metabolite accumulation in prostate tissue, but did not significantly lower 8-OHdG levels, a measure of oxidative damage (35). Although pomegranate juice slowed the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase in men with high PSA levels, data are conflicting (2) (24). A planned subset analysis suggests that those with the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) AA genotype might benefit (36). Supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli, and curcumin resulted in lower rates of PSA increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment (25). An adjunctive intervention with pomegranate juice in men with advanced prostate cancer did not produce significant PSA reductions versus placebo (37).
Recent investigations suggest pomegranate extract can modulate gene expression for both osteoclastic and osteogenic processes in postmenopausal women, suggesting a possible role in bone health (26), but there was no overall association between pomegranate juice intake and hormonal biomarkers for breast cancer risk (38). Pomegranate extract influenced changes in gene expression in colon tissues from colorectal patients (27). In newly-diagnosed CRC patients, pomegranate consumption may lower plasma LPS-binding protein levels, a marker for endotoxemia (33). More studies are needed to determine the implications of such changes.
Although animal studies suggested pomegranate may inhibit cytochrome P450 3A and 2C9 (10) (11) (18), humans studies have not shown clinically relevant interactions (12) (39) (40) (41)."
food_sources	Whole fruit, juice
mechanism_of_action	"Several studies have indicated that pomegranate juice has antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic properties due to the presence of multiple polyphenols such as tannins, flavonols, anthocyanins and ellagic acid. Punicalagin, an ellagitannin, is the most abundant polyphenol that accounts for >50% of antioxidant activity (1) (2).
Animal models indicate that constituents such as ellagic acid and luteolin inhibit metastasis of ovarian cancer by downregulating matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9 (28). In prostate cancer cells, a pomegranate extract induced apoptosis and impaired metastasis, also by downregulating MMP2/MMP9 along with upregulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP2 (29). Prevention of chemically-induced mammary carcinogenesis by another extract likely involved anti-inflammatory mechanisms such as differential regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2p45 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling (30). A pomegranate extract suppressed breast cancer stem cell characteristics by inhibiting the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (31). However, pomegranate extract can also inhibit aromatase activity and decrease the endogenous synthesis of estrogen (5).
Some commercial pomegranate juices are marketed with claims of higher antioxidant activity than green tea and red wine (13). However such effects could be due to colonic microflora metabolites and not the polyphenols present in the juice (14). Recent interest in the link between gut microbiota and cancer explores possible mechanisms. In one RCT, consumption of pomegranate was found to decrease plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) levels, which is a known marker that is associated with the onset and development of colorectal cancer (33)."

contraindications	Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should avoid red clover because it has estrogenic activity (21). Red clover may increase effects of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs (20). Red clover causes toxic effects when used with methotrexate (19).
clinical_summary	"Red clover is a perennial herb traditionally used to treat skin disorders such as psoriasis and eczema, whooping cough, and mastitis. It contains compounds known as isoflavones that act as phytoestrogens. An isoflavone extract is widely promoted as a dietary supplement to relieve menopausal symptoms.
Red clover extract was shown to act as an estrogen agonist and stimulate proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells in vitro (1). However, the isoflavone Biochinin A inhibited aromatase activity and expression (2), thereby conferring a protective effect. In other studies, isoflavone-enriched extracts demonstrated neuroprotective effects in human cortical neurons (3) (4) and reduced skin aging in mice by increasing the amount of collagen (5).
Clinical data show that supplementation with red clover isoflavones improves menopausal symptoms compared with placebo (7) (8), but systematic reviews are mixed (9) (24) (10). In postmenopausal women, supplementation alleviated vasomotor and menopausal symptoms (18) (25). Isoflavones may also improve bone loss (11). In a trial involving osteopenic postmenopausal women, a red clover extract rich in isoflavones, aglycones, and probiotics attenuated bone mineral density loss caused by estrogen deficiency and improved bone turnover (26). Dietary isoflavone intake also improved arterial compliance, an index of large artery elasticity which is an important cardiovascular risk factor (12).

Of concern are findings that red clover inhibits the growth of normal prostate cells and increases resistance of prostate cancer cells to high-dose radiation in vitro (15). Patients should consult with their physicians before taking red clover supplements."

The isoflavone Biochanin A inhibited activity and gene expression of aromatase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgen to estrogen (2). In addition, it protected dopaminergic neurons against lipopolysaccharide-induced damage by inhibiting microglial activation and proinflammatory factors (3). An isoflavone-enriched fraction showed neuroprotective activity in human cortical neurons as well, possibly due to antioxidant and estrogenic effects (4).

clinical_summary	"Reishi mushroom is a fungus that holds an important place in the traditional medical systems of China, Japan, Korea and other Asian countries for its health-promoting effects. It is used as an immunostimulant by patients with HIV and cancer. The active constituents include both beta-glucan polysaccharides and triterpenes.
Extracts of reishi were shown to have immunomodulatory (2) (3) (4) (5) (12), renoprotective (9), anti-inflammatory (36), and hepatoprotective (37) properties both in vitro and in vivo. Clinical studies indicate its benefits in improving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men (10) (20), and in exerting mild antidiabetic effects and improving dyslipidemia (29). However, randomized controlled trials do not support the use of reishi to address cardiovascular risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes (38) (43). A pilot study of reishi spore powder did not find it helpful in treating patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (1).

Reishi has also been studied for its anticancer potential. In vitro and animal studies indicate that it has antiproliferative  (39) and chemopreventive effects (21), alleviates chemotherapy-induced nausea (13), enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy (22), and increases the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin (27). It may also help prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (28).
In small clinical studies, reishi increased plasma antioxidant capacity (6) (7), and enhanced immune responses in cancer patients (8) (40). In another study, a water-soluble reishi extract appeared to suppress development of colorectal adenomas (41). Remission of hepatocellular carcinoma was reported in a few cases in a single study (23). Another case series suggests a dietary supplement containing Reishi mushroom spores may have a negative effect on gastrointestinal cancer patients (42). Currently, there is no evidence for the use of reishi in first-line cancer treatment or to prolong long-term cancer survival. However, it may have a role in stimulating host immunity and enhancing tumor response (44).
An in vitro study reported that reishi mushroom extract has toxic effects in leukocytes (14). There are also a few documented cases of hepatotoxicity (24) (25). More research is therefore needed to determine its safety and effectiveness as an adjunctive cancer treatment."

mechanism_of_action	"Beta glucans, polysaccharides present in reishi, have demonstrated antitumor and immunostimulating activities (18) (40). Its triterpene compounds may inhibit tumor invasion by reducing matrix metalloproteinase expression (16), and tumor metastases by limiting attachment to endothelial cells (17). Recent findings indicate that reishi induces natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines via activation of the natural cytotoxic receptors (NKG2D/NCR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathways, which result in exocytosis of perforin and granulysin (31). Reishi polysaccharides were also shown to increase expression of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and costimulatory molecules on melanoma cells, resulting in enhanced antitumor cytotoxicity (32). In human ovarian cancer cells, reishi inhibits proliferation by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and upregulating connexin 43 expression (39).
In other studies reishi increased plasma antioxidant capacity (6) (7) and enhanced immune response in advance-stage cancer patients (8). Its extracts also inhibited 5-alpha reductase, an important enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and is upregulated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (9)."

clinical_summary	"Shiitake mushroom, native to East Asia, is cultivated worldwide for its purported health benefits. The fresh and dried forms of the mushroom are commonly used in East Asian cooking. It is also valued as an anticancer agent.
Lentinan (1,3 beta-D-glucan), a polysaccharide isolated from shiitake is thought to be responsible for the mushroom’s beneficial effects. Although it has been shown to have anticancer effects (1) (34) (35) (36), lentinan is considered a biological response modifier, rather than having a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells (37). Studies conducted with shiitake extracts in vitro and in animal models reveal immunostimulatory (4), antiviral (31), hepatoprotective (5) (38), antihypercholemic (39), antiproliferative (4), cytotoxic (21), antimutagenic (6), and anticaries (7) properties. Latcripin-13 domain isolated from shiitake was shown to exhibit antitumor activity in lung cancer cells (40).
In a randomized dietary intervention in young adults, eating shiitake mushrooms for 4 weeks altered immune function (41). An orally administered shiitake mycelial extract decreased the incidence of chemotherapy-associated adverse effects in a small study of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer (22), and in combination with immunotherapy, improved QOL in cancer patients (48). But a polysaccharide/oligosaccharide complex from shiitake extract failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of prostate cancer (8). More well-designed studies are needed to establish shiitake as a useful adjunct to cancer treatment."

mechanism_of_action	"Shiitake mushroom supplementation enhanced gut immunity by upregulating interleukin (IL)-23 secretion in a murine model of acute dextran sodium sulfate-colitis (29). Shiitake extracts and the polysaccharide lentinan exerted antiviral effects, by acting on initial replication processes of poliovirus type 1 (PV-1) and bovine herpes virus type 1 (BoHV-1) (31). Another polysaccharide isolated from shiitake exhibited antibacterial effects in mice by increasing T-helper (Th1) cell immunity, resulting in activation of macrophage-mediated immune response (32). The isolated protein lentin exhibited antifungal properties, inhibited proliferation of leukemic cells, and suppressed activity of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (3). Shiitake consumption in adults altered immune function via increased proliferation of gamma delta-T and NK-T cells, increased secretory immunoglobulin A in saliva, increased IL-1alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels, and decreased macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha/chemokine C-C ligand 3 (MIP-1alpha/CCL3) levels (41). A low-molecular-weight lignin from shiitake inhibits hepatitis C virus by binding to viral apolipoprotein E (apoE) before interacting with cell surface heparan sulfate (38).
Eritadenine from shiitake may exert antihypercholemic effects and regulate lipid metabolism by inhibiting S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase activity, and both eritadenine and shiitake mushroom supplementation upregulated CYP7A1 mRNA expression which was decreased in hypercholesterolemic mice (39). High doses of shiitake mushroom prevented obesity in rats by increasing plasma triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver (30).
Dried shiitake extract caused apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells by mediating caspase-3 and -8 pathways  (21). Inhibition of lung cancer cells by the Latcripin-13 domain isolated from shiitake was shown to be due to apoptotic induction (40). Anticancer effects of the polysaccharide lentinan (1,3 beta-D-glucan) may be due to its ability to suppress cytochrome P450 1A enzymes that are known to metabolize procarcinogens to active forms (2). Polysaccharides SLNT1 and JLNT1 isolated from the mushroom also demonstrated antitumor effects by increasing serum IL-2 levels and TNF-α production, and by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells in mice (33)."

clinical_summary	"Siberian ginseng is derived from a perennial plant primarily found in Northern Asia. Although it is not a species of ginseng, it is thought to have comparable activities. Siberian ginseng, or eleuthero, has been used traditionally as an adaptogen, performance enhancer, and immunostimulant (2). Active components include eleutherosides and polysaccharides (28).

In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that Siberian ginseng extracts have neuroprotective effects (8); reduce glucose levels in insulin-deficient animals (9); bind to estrogen, progestin, and mineralocorticoid receptors (10); and stimulate T-lymphocyte and natural killer cell production (11).

A small study of patients with knee osteoarthritis found that an herbal mixture containing Siberian ginseng relieved pain and improved physical function (5). Siberian ginseng may also improve endurance (27), have beneficial effects on bone remodeling (6), and help in managing cholesterol levels in postmenopausal women (7)."
food_sources	
mechanism_of_action	"In vitro studies indicate that eleuthero contains chemicals that bind to estrogen, progestin, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid receptors (10). In macrophages, a Siberian ginseng extract suppressed LPS-induced iNOS expression and thus nitric oxide production by possibly inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B activity (15) (16) or Akt and JNK signaling (16), and inhibited reactive oxygen species production (17).
Eleutheroside B, eleutheroside E, and isofraxidin — active constituents of Siberian ginseng — showed protective effects against Aβ(25-35)-induced atrophies of axons and dendrites in rat cultured cortical neurons (22). Isofraxidin also inhibited cell invasion and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-7 by human hepatoma cell lines HuH-7 and Hep G-2, possibly through the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (18).
In animal studies, eleuthero root bark was shown to exhibit neuroprotective effects against global cerebral ischemia with recovery of spatial memory in rats, possibly through anti-inflammatory mechanisms of inhibition of COX-2 expression, microglia and astrocyte expression (23). Eleutherosides restored behavioral and biochemical alterations in mice with sleep deprivation (24), and alleviated both physical and mental fatigue in mice possibly due to increased fat utilization, delayed accumulation of blood urea nitrogen, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (25). Eleutherosides also mediate hyperglycemic effects of Siberian ginseng by regulating insulin signaling and glucose utilization (29).
In other studies, a Siberian ginseng extract decreased cadmium concentration in the blood and liver of mice as well as cadmium-induced mitotic and apoptotic activity of liver cells (26). Supplementation with Siberian ginseng reduced LDL cholesterol levels and improved LDL/HDL ratios in postmenopausal women (7).
Siberian ginseng extract was shown to moderately inhibit breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)-mediated methotrexate transport in BCRP-expressing membrane vesicles (21)."

warnings	Laboratory findings indicate that dietary turmeric may inhibit the anti-tumor action of chemotherapeutic agents such as cyclophosphamide (28). Curcumin may also interact with drugs that are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (47) (48) or cytochrome P450 enzymes (48) (49). Patients with gastrointestinal disorders or predisposed to kidney stone formation (50) should also use this supplement with caution.
contraindications	Patients with bile duct obstruction, gallstones, and GI disorders including stomach ulcers and hyperacidity disorders should not take this supplement (51).
clinical_summary	"Turmeric is a plant that is native to South Asia but is cultivated in tropical areas around the world. The rhizome is used as a spice in regional cuisines, and as a coloring agent in food and cosmetics for its yellow-orange color. It is also used in traditional medicine for improving circulation and digestion. Turmeric extracts are marketed as dietary supplements to improve memory, for arthritis, and for cancer prevention.
The active constituents are turmerone oil and water-soluble curcuminoids, mainly curcumin which is the focus of most research. In vitro studies suggest that curcumin, the principal bioactive ingredient of turmeric, acts as a weak phytoestrogen (1), and exhibits neuroprotective (2), choleretic (3), anti-inflammatory (4), immunomodulatory (5), anti-proliferative (3), and chemopreventive effects (6) (7) (8). Curcumin, its analogs, and liposomal formulations have also produced chemosensitizing (9) (10) (11) and radiosensitizing effects (12) (13).
Turmeric and its active constituents have been investigated for their therapeutic activities in humans. A clinical trial suggests it may be effective against major depressive disorder  (62). Data from an epidemiological study suggest improved cognitive performance in elderly Asians who consume turmeric in the form of curry powder (14); however, there were no benefits from curcumin supplementation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (15). Turmeric may help alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome  (16) or quiescent ulcerative colitis (17), but in a double-blind randomized trial of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, there was no reduction in lower intestinal tract adenomas with long-term use of curcumin versus placebo  (70).
Turmeric extract was found to be safe and equally effective as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee (18). Whether curcumin supplementation increases cholesterol levels is unclear, as study results are mixed (19) (20). In a study of postmenopausal women, consumption of curcumin along with aerobic exercise training were shown to improve vascular endothelial function (61).
Turmeric has also been studied in cancer patients. Oral curcumin administered to colorectal cancer patients during the pre-surgery waiting period improved cachexia and the general health of patients (21). In a phase II trial of oral curcumin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, no treatment-related toxic effects were observed, and clinically relevant biological activity was seen in two patients despite limited absorption (22). Other preliminary results suggest turmeric during capecitabine treatment may reduce rates of hand-foot syndrome  (71). In another study, supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli and curcumin resulted in a reduction in the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment (65).
In early phase studies, a combination of curcumin and docetaxel was shown to be safe (23). Curcumin with gemcitabine was also found to be safe and feasible for further study (24) (25), but a high dose of curcumin must be used to achieve systemic effect (23) (25). A dose-finding trial of a curcumin extract to determine safety and efficacy for patients with metastatic disease undergoing standard FOLFOX chemotherapy is currently underway (72). 
Preliminary data suggest effectiveness of a topical turmeric-based cream for reduction of radiotherapy-induced dermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer (64).
Curcumin is known to interfere with cytochrome P450 enzymes (26) (27) and may interact with chemotherapy drugs like cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (28). Overall, the development of turmeric for clinical use needs further investigation due to its inherent poor absorption, rapid metabolism, complex mechanistic profile, and largely preclinical data."
food_sources	Turmeric is a major ingredient in curry powder, a spice commonly found in South Asian food.
mechanism_of_action	"The hepatoprotective effects of curcumin, the most researched active constituent in turmeric, may occur via MMP-13 induction and TGF-alpha inhibition (30), as well as anti-apoptotic/anti-necrotic mechanisms (31). However, it has also been shown to inhibit cell-cycle progression during normal liver regeneration (3).
A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials revealed that curcumin is effective in decreasing the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a key mediator in many inflammatory diseases (68). In vitro and animal studies of lung models point to antiproliferative and modulatory mechanisms involving inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 Stat3 pathway (32), matrix metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor (33); caspase- and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (34) (35); and cyclin-dependent kinase downregulation (35). Curcumin also appears to have synergistic effects with isoflavones, suppressing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production in prostate cells through anti-androgen effects (36).

Studies done on breast cancer show that curcumin may inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via inhibition of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (28). Data also suggest that curcumin induces apoptosis in human colon cancer cells independent of p21 expression (39). Curcumin’s antitumor actions appear to be due to its interactions with arachidonate metabolism and its in vivo antiangiogenic properties (14). Another possible chemopreventive mechanism may be via binding and activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR), thereby protecting the small intestine and colon where VDRs are expressed and vitamin D is known to serve an anticancer function (38). Curcumin also inhibited growth of uterine leiomyosarcoma cells by targeting the AKT-mTOR (RAC-alpha serine-threonine-protein kinase; mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway (37). Curcumin may inhibit bladder cancer progression by downregulating the expression of beta-catenin, high levels of which are associated with several cancers (69).
Another study found that CRM1, an important nuclear exportin, is a cellular target of curcumin; and that the inhibition of nuclear traffic by curcumin may be responsible for its many biological effects (63)."

contraindications	Vitamin B12 may increase the risk of in-stent restenosis in patients after coronary stenting (15).
clinical_summary	"Vitamin B12, part of the vitamin B-complex family, refers to the group of compounds that consists of cyanocobalamin, hydroxycobalamin, and related substances (1). It is essential for normal nerve function, DNA synthesis, hematopoiesis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid synthesis in the mitochondria. It also plays an important role in homocysteine metabolism.
Vitamin B12 is abundant in diets that include meat and dairy products, although a deficiency can occur in those who have malabsorption syndromes (2), take medications for gastric disorders (3) (4) or for conditions associated with insulin resistance (5), or those who follow a strict vegetarian diet (6). B12 deficiency is also more common among the elderly (7). Lack of B12 can lead to a wide variety of hematologic, neurologic, and psychiatric disorders, and may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (8). Vitamin B12 is often included in vitamin products used to reduce homocysteine which is associated with cardiovascular diseases. High dietary intakes of B vitamins including B12 have been associated with a decreased risk for cataracts (36). However, combination supplementation with B12, B6, and folic acid may actually increase the risk of cataract extraction (37).
Although low serum B12 levels have been associated with increased bone turnover and fracture risk (9), long-term B12 and folic acid supplementation did not improve bone mineral density (38) or reduce osteoporotic fracture incidence in elderly individuals with elevated plasma homocysteine levels (39).
Repletion of vitamin B12 may improve response in patients resistant to antidepressants (10), and in older adults with major depression, long-term supplementation with a combination of B12, B6, and folic acid enhanced antidepressant treatment efficacy (40). However, among middle-age and older women, this combination homocysteine-lowering supplementation over 7 years’ average treatment duration did not result in reduced depression risk compared with placebo, despite significant homocysteine level reductions (41).
Homocystene-lowering therapy may have some cardiovascular benefits after coronary interventions (11), but does not appear to reduce risk of further cardiovascular events including stroke (12) (13) (14). In addition, increased risk of in-stent restenosis with such treatment has been reported in patients after coronary stenting (15). In a large Dutch study known as the B-PROOF trial, 2 years of B12 and folic acid supplementation in hyperhomocysteinemic elderly patients also had no effect on arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis (42). In a long-term field study of individuals residing in India at high altitude however, B12 and folic acid supplementation reduced thrombosis incidence (43). A large study of B12, folic acid, and B6 supplementation to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke among a large Chinese population is underway (44).
B12 as part of homocysteine-lowering therapy or B12 repletion therapy (45) does not improve cognitive function (16) (17) (18) (19), even though low-normal B12 concentrations are associated with poorer memory performance (46). This was further echoed in secondary data from the aforementioned B-PROOF study which showed improving homocysteine levels does not improve cognitive outcomes (47), although the intervention may positvely affect gait and physical performance in the elderly (48).
Increased intake of B12, folate and B6 may lower the risks for breast (20) (21) (22) and cervical (23) cancers, but not lung cancer (24). In fact, long-term use of vitamin B12 supplement is associated with increased risk of lung cancer, especially in male smokers (53). Another large study did not find an effect with this combination on overall risk of invasive cancer or breast cancer (25). However, data from a Norwegian study suggest higher cancer incidence and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease following B12 and folic acid supplementation (26), although these effects appeared to be mediated by folic acid. Dietary intake of folate and B12 during pregnancy is associated with a lower risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children (49). Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
Intramuscular B12 injections and oral folic acid reduces toxicity of pemetrexed chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (27), and may also help to improve treatment efficacy (28) (29), whereas oral administration of vitamin B12 for this purpose does not (50).
A large Danish population study identified high plasma B12 levels as related to elevated risks for hematological, smoking-related, and alcohol-related cancers (51) and that cancer patients with elevated B12 levels had higher mortality than those with normal values (52). However, such elevations are probably are due to changes in cobalamin metabolism caused by the cancer. It does not suggest that B12 supplementation can cause cancer."

mechanism_of_action	"Vitamin B12 is involved in the transfer of methyl groups and methylation reactions essential for the synthesis of phospholipids and neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. B12 is also required for synthesis of nucleic acid, notably DNA, the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids in the mitochondria, and in delivering SAMe, the universal methyl donor (16) (30). In humans, two enzymatic reactions dependent on B12 are produced and activated in two separate cellular compartments: methylcobalamin in the cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria (1). As a coenzyme in methyl transfer reactions, it converts homocysteine to methionine, and it also participates in L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) conversion to succinyl-CoA (8). In the first enzyme reaction, methylcobalamin is used to recycle the folate cofactor 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate thereby allowing the folate cofactor to participate in a cycle involving the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. During this reaction, homocysteine is converted to methionine yielding the methyl groups required for methylation that is essential in biosynthesis (31).
When used with pemetrexed, B12/folic acid therapy further increases sub-G1 populations in human adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma cell lines, independent of p53 status (28)."

clinical_summary	"Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin derived from plant. Natural food sources include plant oils, wheat germ, eggs, green leafy vegetables, and whole grains (3). Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and is thought to help prevent and treat many diseases. Although available in a variety of formulations, only the d-isomer is considered active (1).
Studies evaluating vitamin E supplementation suggest that it may improve immune response in the elderly. Vitamin E may slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (9) (15) (16) (18); however, conflicting data from another study do not support the utility of antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, lipoid acid, and Coenzyme Q) (43).  It was also ineffective in arresting the development or progression of macular degeneration (14) and Early Parkinson’s Disease (21).

Vitamin E did not decrease the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections (12), reduce mortality, or reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or cerebrovascular accident (26). When taken along with vitamin C, vitamin E may increase mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease (13). Further, findings from the recent Physicians’ Health Study II show that neither vitamin E nor C is beneficial in preventing cardiovascular events; vitamin E may actually increase the risk of stroke (36). The Women’s Health Study also failed to find any benefit of vitamin E supplementation in lowering the risk of heart failure in healthy women (42). A meta-analysis showed that vitamin E increases the risk for hemorrhagic stroke but reduces the risk of ischemic stroke (38). Vitamin E can reduce signs and symptoms of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in adults (45), but not in children and adolescents (46) .
Vitamin E was shown to reduce the risk of some cancers (19) (20). It may help to relieve hot flashes in breast cancer survivors (27), and to reduce the incidence of cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity (22). However, data suggest that supplementation with vitamins C, E, and beta carotene is not beneficial in preventing cancer incidence or affecting cancer mortality (37). Furthermore, vitamin E when used alone or with other supplements did not prevent gastrointestinal cancer (28). A large scale clinical Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) evaluated the role of vitamin E in prostate cancer prevention. Initial review shows that vitamin E taken alone or with selenium for 5 years did not reduce the risk of prostate cancer (35); observational data from 7 years of participant follow-up indicate a significant increase in the risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E supplementation (41). Vitamin E, when used together with soy and selenium, did not prevent prostate cancer progression (40). Further, findings from other studies indicate vitamin E may actually increase risk of lung cancer (33) and overall mortality (28). At the same time, conflicting data suggest an association between dietary tocopherol and a reduction in risk of lung cancer (38) (48). Also, both dietary and supplemental form of vitamin E may reduce the risk of liver cancer (44).

Toxicity may occur with chronic supplementation of vitamin E with doses greater than 800 IU. Daily supplementation over 400 IU may increase all-cause mortality (29). Vitamin E may also enhance the activity of warfarin, but data are inconsistent (7) (8)."

mechanism_of_action	"Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant. The natural form of vitamin E is composed of 4 different tocopherols and 4 different tocotrienol homologues (alpha, beta, delta and gamma). All 8 forms have antioxidant activity but recent data indicate that the different homologues have different activities unrelated to antioxidant effects (34).
Gamma-tocopherol is a stronger inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and traps reactive oxygen species more effectively than alpha-tocopherol. In vitro and in vivo, gamma-tocopherol exhibits anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects where alpha-tocopherol does not (34) . While both alpha- and gamma-tocopherols exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo, gamma-enriched mixed tocopherols may be more potent compared to alpha-tocopherols. This may help explain the negative outcomes of recent large-scale intervention studies that used only the alpha homologue (34).
The d-alpha-tocopherol isomer is believed to be the active principle. Natural vitamin E supplements contain d-alpha-tocopherol derived from plant oil sources, whereas synthetic supplements are composed of a racemic mixture of d- and l-alpha-tocopherols. The major function of d-alpha-tocopherol is to prevent the propagation of free radical reactions by acting as a peroxyl radical scavenger and protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) within membrane phospholipids and in plasma lipoproteins. Alpha-tocopherol reportedly causes inhibition of protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes. Vitamin E enrichment of endothelial cells, down regulates the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), thereby decreasing the adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium. Vitamin E also upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxegenase-1, which leads to the release of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation in humans (3).
In an animal study, vitamin E increased lung cancer cell proliferation due to its antioxidant activity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and p53 expression (47)."
